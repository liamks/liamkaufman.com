<h2>Current</h2>
<p>
  Currently I work full-time as a developer at <a href="http://www.eventmobi.com/">EventMobi</a>. My primary focus is front-end development using Backbone.js and more recently Angular.js. Additionally, I help with other parts of the stack including those built in Node.js, PHP and Python.
</p>
<p>
  Until March 2013 I was working fulltime on <a href="http://understoodit.com">Understoodit.com</a>, a web application I created that helped students voice their confusion in real-time. Since its launch Understoodit has been featured on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/02/understoodit-lets-students-voice-their-confusion-without-having-to-raise-their-hands/">TechCrunch</a>, <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/article/1173277--don-t-get-what-the-prof-s-talking-about-there-s-an-app-for-that">The Toronto Star</a>, <a href="http://news.discovery.com/tech/understoodit-app-120514.html">Discovery.com</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXUs90BZpb0">CTV</a> and more. In March, Understoodit was acquired by <a href="http://www.eventmobi.com/">EventMobi</a>.

  Previously I worked as a software developer in the <a href="http://taglab.utoronto.ca/">TAG Lab</a>, at the University of Toronto. At the TAG Lab I helped to develope an iOS application for individuals with low vision and those with Multiple Sclerosis that was featured in <a href="http://www.magazine.utoronto.ca/feature/technologies-for-aging-gracefully-taglab-ronald-baecker-brent-ledger/">U of T Magazine</a> and <a href="http://www.news.utoronto.ca/e-reading-grandma">U of T News</a>. Outside
  of work I sharpen my skills by creating JavaScript based web applications and contributing to open source projects (<a href="https://github.com/maccman/macgap">MacGap</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com"> learn.jquery.com</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate">backbone-boilerplate</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib">grunt-contrib</a>).

<h2>Academic</h2>
<h3>Before Computer Science</h3>
<p>
  By 2005 I had completed a BA, and an Honours BSc, in Psychology at the University of Western
  Ontario that helped to cultivate interests in neurosciences and neuroimaging. In the fall of 2005 I moved to Vancouver and began working with a neurologist, at BC Children's Hospital, helping with pre-surgical brain mapping for
  children with epilepsy.
</p>
<p>
  In 2006 I started an M.Sc., in Medical Sciences, at the University of Toronto. While I was suppose to be working on my thesis, I became increasingly interested in programming. Initially I was learning ruby to parse my thesis data but I quickly spent more and more time programming for fun solving projecteuler.net questions. Since I enjoyed
  developing software, and I was frustrated with the software that neuroscientists used,
  I decided I would complete my M.Sc. and then do a B.Sc. in computer science.
</p>
<h3>Computer Science</h3>
<p>
  Computer science at U of T was both challenging and immensely rewarding. I enjoyed the algorithm courses,
  as well as the systems courses. As time progressed I enjoyed building JavaScript based web applications
  more and more. In part, the technologies were improving and my skill sets were making exploration
  of libraries and new technologies much easier. 
</p>
<p>
  My eclectic background has meant that I have had to work hard in a lot of different areas, such as writing, 
  presenting and problem solving. In University I observed that good communication was an asset in
  every subject I studied because it helped me to explain myself in presentations, essays and even in code.
