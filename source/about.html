<h2>Current</h2>
<p>
  Currently I am self-employed and working on personal and client-based projects.
  Previously I worked as a software developer in the <a href="http://taglab.utoronto.ca/">TAG Lab</a>, at the University of Toronto. At the TAG Lab I helped to develope an iOS application to improve reading accessibility for individuals with low vision and those with Multiple Sclerosis. Outside
  of work I sharpen my skills by creating JavaScript based web applications and delving deeper
  into programming.

<h2>Academic</h2>
<h3>Before Computer Science</h3>
<p>
  By 2005 I had completed a BA, and an Honours BSc, in Psychology at the University of Western
  Ontario that helped to cultivate interests in neurosciences and neuroimaging. In the fall of 2005 I moved to Vancouver and began working with a neurologist, at BC Children's Hospital, helping with pre-surgical brain mapping for
  children with epilepsy.

<p>
  In 2006 I started an M.Sc., in Medical Sciences, at the University of Toronto. While I was suppose to be working on my thesis, I became increasingly interested in programming. Initially I was learning ruby to parse my thesis data but I quickly spent more and more time programming for fun and and to help solve projecteuler.net questions. Since I enjoyed
  developing software, and I was frustrated with the software that neuroscientists used,
  I decided I would complete my M.Sc. and then do a B.Sc. in computer science.

<h3>Computer Science</h3>
<p>
  Computer science at U of T was both challenging and immensely rewarding. I enjoyed the algorithm courses,
  as well as the systems courses. As time progressed I enjoyed building JavaScript based web applications
  more and more. In part, the technologies were improving and my skill sets were making exploration
  of libraries and new technologies much easier. 
</p>
<p>
  My eclectic background has meant that I have had to work hard in a lot of different areas, such as writing, 
  presenting and problem solving. In University I observed that good communication was an asset in
  every subject I studied because it helped me explain myself in presentations, essays and even in code.
