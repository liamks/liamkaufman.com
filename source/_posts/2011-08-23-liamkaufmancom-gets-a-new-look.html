After 3 years without change, I've redone my personal website using Jekyll and Bootstrap. The previous version of liamkaufman.com was hosted on Google App Engine and consisted of a very basic CMS that I made before I knew what I was doing. I was both unhappy with the look of the site, and the code behind it. At the same time I was interested in using Jekyll, as I wanted to avoid the hassles associated with database backed sites. I also appreciate the fact that my site, and it’s content are easy to deploy and update via Github.

Overall the process of learning Jekyll and Bootstrap was much easier than anticipated. To learn Jekyll I examined the <a href="https://github.com/schacon/schacon.github.com">source code</a> behind <a href="http://schacon.github.com/">Scott Chacon’s blog</a>. Learning Bootstrap consisted of referencing CSS classes in my DOM and referencing the Bootstrap CSS file itself: not much to it.
