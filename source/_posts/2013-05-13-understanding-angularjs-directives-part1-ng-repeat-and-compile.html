<p>
  My first impression of Angular.js was one of amazement. A small amount of code could do a lot. My worry with Angular, and other magical frameworks, is that initially you are productive, but eventually you hit a dead end requiring full understanding of how the magic works. In my quest to master Angular.js, I wanted to learn everything about creating custom directives - a goal that I’d hope would ameliorate the learning curve. <a href="http://www.egghead.io/">Egghead.io</a> does a good job exploring basic, and intermediate, examples of custome directives but it still wasn’t clear when to use the compile parameter in a custome directive. 
</p>
<p>
  Miško Hevery, the creator of AngularJS, <a href="http://blog.angularjs.org/2012/11/about-those-directives.html">gave a talk about directives and explained</a> that compile is rarely needed for custom directives, and it is only required for directives like <code>ng-repeat</code> and <code>ng-view</code>. So the next question: how does <code>ng-repeat</code> work?
</p>

<h2>How does ng-repeat work?</h2>
<p>
  In my quest to understand the compile function, I started examining ng-repeat. Reading the source code was difficult until I walked through an example using the Chrome debugger. After stepping through <code>ng-repeat</code> it became clear that most of its 150 lines of code are related to optimizing, error handling and handling objects or arrays. In order to really understand ng-repeat, and specifically compile, I set out to implement my own version of ng-repeat, which I will call <code>lk-repeat</code>, with just the bare minimum of code. When possible I tried to use the same variable names that ng-repeat uses, and I also used their regular expression for matching passed in attributes.
</p>

<h2>Transclusion</h2>
<p>
  Before going further it's important to review the transclude option. Transclude has two options: 1) <code>true</code> or 2) <code>'element'</code>. First let's examine <code>transclude : true</code>.
</p>


```html DIV using the person directive
<div person>Ted</div>
```

```javascript Defining the person directive
app.directive('person', function(){
  return {
    transclude : true,
    template: '<h1>A Person</h1><div ng-transclude></div>',
    link : function($scope, $element, $attr){
      // some code
    }
  }
});
```

```html Result
<h1>A Person</h1><div ng-transclude><div person>Ted</div></div>
```

<p>
  In the above example <code>transclude : true</code> tells Angular to take the contents of the DOM element, using this directive, and insert them into the person's template. To specify where in the template the HTML will be transcluded include <code>ng-transclude</code> in the template.
</p>

<p>
  In contrast to the above example, <code>ng-repeat</code>, does not have a template, and transcludes the element that calls <code>ng-repeat</code>. Hence, <code>ng-repeat</code> calls <code>transclude : 'element'</code>, to denote that the DOM element that called <code>ng-repeat</code> will be used for transclusion.
</p>

<h2>lk-repeat</h2>
<p>Below <code>lk-repeat</code> is used the same way <code>ng-repeat</code> would be used.</p>
```html
<ul>
  <li lk-repeat="name in names">{{name}}</li>
</ul>
```

```javascript
var app = angular.module('myApp',[]);

app.directive('lk-repeat', function(){
  return {
    transclude : 'element',
    compile : function(element, attr, linker){
      return function($scope, $element, $attr){
        var myLoop = $attr.lkRepeat,
            match = myLoop.match(/^\s*(.+)\s+in\s+(.*?)\s*(\s+track\s+by\s+(.+)\s*)?$/),
            indexString = match[1],
            collectionString = match[2],
            parent = $element.parent(),
            elements = [];

        // $watchCollection is called everytime the collection is modified
        $scope.$watchCollection(collectionString, function(collection){
          var i, block, childScope;

          // check if elements have already been rendered
          if(elements.length > 0){
            // if so remove them from DOM, and destroy their scope
            for (i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
              elements[i].el.remove();
              elements[i].scope.$destroy();
            };
            elements = [];
          }

          for (i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {
            // create a new scope for every element in the collection.
            childScope = $scope.$new();
            // pass the current element of the collection into that scope
            childScope[indexString] = collection[i];

            linker(childScope, function(clone){
              // clone the transcluded element, passing in the new scope.
              parent.append(clone); // add to DOM
              block = {};
              block.el = clone;
              block.scope = childScope;
              elements.push(block);
            });
          };        
        });
      }
    }
  }
}); 
```
<p>
  Above you'll note that I'm removing all the elements from the DOM, and their scope, every time the collection updates. While this makes the code easier to understand, it is extremely inefficient having to remove everything then add it again. In the real version of <code>ng-repeat</code>, only elements that are removed from the collection, are removed from the DOM. Furthermore, if an item moves within the collection (e.g. 2nd to 4th place) it doesn't need a new scope, but it needs to be moved in the DOM. Reading <code>ng-repeat</code>'s code gives me confidence that the team behind AngularJS has created a good, well tested and efficient framework.

  In part 2 I plan on exploring another directive. If you have any recommendations let me know below, or via twitter.
